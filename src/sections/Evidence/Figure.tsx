/**
 * An evidence figure, counted up with Magic UI's NumberTicker.
 *
 * Two things the bare component would get wrong here:
 *
 * 1. It renders `startValue` (0) until motion animates it. If motion never runs
 *    — reduced motion, JS disabled, a crawler reading the HTML — the page would
 *    claim "0 clinicians surveyed", which is worse than no animation. So the
 *    real number is what renders on the server and what a reduced-motion
 *    visitor keeps; the ticker only takes over after mount.
 * 2. It hardcodes `text-ink dark:text-ink`, and this site does not use a
 *    `dark` class, so `text-ink` would land near-invisible on the ink ground.
 *    The className below overrides it through twMerge.
 *
 * The swap is invisible in practice because this section is far below the fold,
 * so the ticker mounts long before it scrolls into view.
