 *
 * Portrait notes:
 *  - Founders: 1024×1536 studio photos from the document.
 *  - Advisor portraits were supplied directly by the user for publication.
 *    Diana Zidarov added 2026-08 from the user-supplied OneDrive_2 folder (file

 *    (2026-08-17) were removed at the user's request; their portraits are
 *    still in /images/team/advisors. Caution that still stands: some supplied
 *    portraits carry an AI-retouched finish (Diana's included) — confirm each
 *    person's sign-off before launch.

/* Diana sits right after Cyril, and Catherine right after François Michaud,
   because the pairs are meant to read side by side (2026-08-11). The grid is
   4 columns on desktop and 2 from sm up, so the pairs must sit at positions
   1-2 and 3-4 to hold at both widths — which pushed Drolet out of the lead
   slot when Murielle Grangeon was removed (2026-08-17; her portrait stays in
   /images/team/advisors). Alexandre Girard (added 2026-08-20) sits at
   position 5 with Drolet closing the list at 6, so the last row is full at
   every width. Inserting or removing an advisor shifts all of this: check the
   pairs again whenever the list changes length.

   Cyril and Diana's shared title (university professor, physiotherapy and
   rehabilitation sciences, no IURDPM mention) is the user's wording
   (2026-08-17), replacing the CRSNG/PSO roles. */
